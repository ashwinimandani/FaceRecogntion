# FaceRecogntion Using Transfer Learning

Transfer Learning is a Machine Learning technique where we use the model that has been already trained and we can add the final and dense layers according to our needs. 
I have used ResNet50 but we can use others architectures such as VGG16, VGG19, MobileNet. I have added the final dense layer with 1000 neurons and output layers with two neurons as we have images of two different people.
